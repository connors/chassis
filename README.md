# [Chassis](http://connors.github.io/chassis)

A lightweight HTML & CSS base layer for mobile-first web development.

Chassis provides you with base CSS and HTML files to jump start your web development. If you're looking for a full featured front-end framework, you're in the wrong place. Chassis only gives you what you need and nothing else.

## Getting started

- [Read the docs](http://connors.github.io/chassis) to learn how to create simple layouts and use Chassis' base layer styles.

## Documentation

Chassis' documentation is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://github.com/connors/chassis>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

2. From the root `/chassis` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
3. Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:9001) in your browser, and boom!
